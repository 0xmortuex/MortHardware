| [`fd12701`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/fd12701) | Verified the complete live TLS server flight: bounded transcript accumulation, leaf certificate DER/RSA/RTC-validity checks, RSA-PSS CertificateVerify verification, and server Finished verification; chain trust remains fail-closed. |
| [`e3c8e00`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/e3c8e00) | Added an explicit trust-on-first-use workflow for private HTTPS: SHA-256 leaf fingerprints are scoped to host and port, saved in MortFS only after `K` approval, compared in constant time, and never persisted from private mode. |
| [`6a59ad8`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/6a59ad8) | Completed the pinned TLS client handshake: live master/application secrets and traffic keys, encrypted client Finished, host-confirmed handshake completion, sequence-zero application state, prompt close of untrusted connections, and key cleanup on failure. |
| [`bd417cf`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/bd417cf) | Enabled authenticated pinned HTTPS pages: encrypted GET requests, application-record authentication/decryption, bounded NewSessionTicket handling, safe HTTP accumulation/rendering, HTTPS UI state, application-key cleanup, and FIN-safe delivery of the final TLS record. |
| [`df3a408`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/df3a408) | Added visible HTTPS trust management in Browser Settings, persistent-pin clearing, secure-scheme preservation for relative links, authenticated-page link extraction coverage, and corrected stale UI capability descriptions. |
| [`11ed913`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/11ed913) | Audited and corrected the browser's security claims and live Network status so working pinned HTTPS is distinguished precisely from the still-unimplemented public-CA chain/root-store mode. |
| [`c8f71ab`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/c8f71ab) | Added bounded RSA certificate-chain traversal, full-chain RTC validity checks, exact issuer/subject linking, SHA256-with-RSA child-signature verification, final-anchor fingerprint pins, and a renewal regression using two different leaves under one private CA. |
| [`316412c`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/316412c) | Enforced X.509 roles and identity: CA/leaf BasicConstraints, keyCertSign/digitalSignature usage, serverAuth EKU, DNS or IPv4 SAN matching, duplicate-role rejection, and fail-closed unknown critical extensions. |
| [`52ca551`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/52ca551) | Added a bounded per-user MortFS CA-root store, strict self-signed DER import, constant-time anchor lookup, private-mode refusal, Vex Settings import/clear controls, automatic trust across independent leaf renewals, and BasicConstraints path-length enforcement. |
| [`6c83a98`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/6c83a98) | Upgraded imported roots from hash-only pins to validated DER trust anchors, migrated legacy VXR1 stores, completed chains against a local issuer when servers omit the root, and enforced the local root's path-length constraint. |
| [`25d2460`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/25d2460) | Expanded Vex trust storage to fifteen DER anchors within one MortFS extent and added atomic concatenated-DER bundle import, duplicate skipping, VXR1/VXR2 migration, capacity enforcement, persistence, and invalid-bundle rollback. |
| [`dd6e778`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/dd6e778) | Added bounded non-text HTTP/HTTPS downloads: Vex stages up to 12 KiB outside the text renderer, derives and sanitizes a MortFS filename from the URL, saves the exact bytes only on explicit request, and reports the last saved filename and size. |
| [`337ca1b`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/337ca1b) | Brought the Claude-designed MortuexOS desktop language into the real framebuffer kernel and began the canonical Vex native port: shared gold-diamond identity, warm browser shell, vertical tabs/library, floating dock, rounded UI primitives, and an explicit upstream-to-native boundary document. |
| [`123d73a`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/123d73a) | Added Personal, Work, School, and Dev Vex workspaces with independent four-tab stacks and persisted active-workspace selection. |
| [`093c91e`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/093c91e) | Added the canonical-style `Ctrl+K` Vex command bar with page navigation, new/private tab actions, workspace switching, and address fallback. |
| [`7e84cbe`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/7e84cbe) | Replaced the session-only last-download display with an eight-record MortFS manager containing exact filename, byte count, text/binary kind, and HTTP/HTTPS metadata; private saves remain deliberately unrecorded. |
| [`f36c5fb`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/f36c5fb) | Added strict shared HTTP/1.0/1.1 status-line parsing for normal responses and redirects, rejecting unsupported versions, non-decimal codes, and missing separators before body rendering. |
| [`32aeb7e`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/32aeb7e) | Added four persistent named Vex session snapshots, private-mode save refusal, a Saved Sessions page, command-bar save/open/delete workflows, and case-insensitive on-device History search. |
| [`76dc419`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/76dc419) | Added a native reading layout and eight persistent per-origin profiles for reading mode and extracted-link policy, enforced private-mode non-persistence, and repaired alias-unsafe reload so saved controls reapply on a real refresh. |
| [`c0aa1ca`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/c0aa1ca) | Hardened HTTP message framing with line-anchored header recognition, bounded decimal Content-Length parsing, duplicate/ambiguous framing rejection, and truncated-body refusal before rendering. |
| [`eb933c7`](https://github.com/0xmortuex/MortOS/commit/eb933c7) | Completed browser-data clearing for download metadata, named sessions, and per-site profiles through Settings and the command bar, with private-mode refusal and preservation of downloaded MortFS files. |

## Demonstrated results

- AC'97 initialized and accepted a 48 kHz PCM test-tone buffer.
- UHCI enumerated QEMU's USB tablet as one device, read VID/PID `0627:0001`, and identified USB interface class `3` (HID).

## What this does not claim

- No new physical hardware was manufactured.
- PCI Wi-Fi detection is not a Wi-Fi MAC/PHY driver.
- USB Bluetooth-class recognition is not yet a Bluetooth HCI, L2CAP, pairing, or profile stack.
- USB keyboard support is not yet a general hub, hot-plug, arbitrary-HID, storage, or isochronous subsystem.
- QEMU validation is not proof of compatibility with arbitrary physical chip revisions.

These distinctions are deliberate so readers can see exactly what MortOS can do today and what remains engineering work.
